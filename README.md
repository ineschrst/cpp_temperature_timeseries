# C++ Environmental Time Series Processor

## Project Goal
This project demonstrates how to process environmental time series data in C++ efficiently.  
The goal is to practice file handling, parsing CSV files, and using STL algorithms for basic statistics.

## Current Features
- Reads numeric values from CSV files
- Includes one data file with temperature data from basel
- Computes basic statistics: mean, minimum, maximum
- Handles missing or invalid data gracefully
